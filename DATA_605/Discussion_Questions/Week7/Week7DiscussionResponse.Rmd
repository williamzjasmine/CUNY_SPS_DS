Question comes from ["Introduction to Probability"](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf) by Charles M. Grinstead.

# Question 3, Section 5.1
## Problem Description:

Let $X$ be a random variable which can take on countably many values. Show
that $X$ cannot be uniformly distributed.

## Solution

Assume that the set of values $V$ that $X$ can take on is countably infinite, and that $X$ is uniformly distributed. Thus, it must be the case that there is some $p$ > 0 such that $P(X=v) = a$ for all $v\in V$. Furthermore, it must be the case that $\sum_{v\in V} a = 1$. However, since $V$ is infinite in size, and $p>0$, $\sum_{v\in V} a = \infty$. Thus, we have a contradiction and show that $X$ cannot be uniformly distributed.
