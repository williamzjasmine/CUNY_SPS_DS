Question comes from ["Introduction to Probability"](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf) by Charles M. Grinstead.

# Question 3a, Section 7.2
## Problem Description:

Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with:

$$
\begin{equation}
f_X(x) = f_Y(x) =     
  \begin{cases}
        \frac{x}{2} & \text{if } 0 < x < 2\\
        0 & \text{otherwise }
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

Suppose that $Z = X + Y$. Find $f_Z$.

## Solution 

To sample the PDF distribution $f_X(x)$ we can pick random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and see when those values are equal to $F_X(x)$ (the CDF of $X$). First, we evaluate $F_X(x)$: 


$$
\begin{align}
F_X(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(x) dx \\
F_X(x) &= \int_{0}^x\frac{x}{2} dx \\
F_X(x) &= \frac{x^2}{4}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, to perform our sampling, given a random number $r$ from our uniform distribution from 0 to 1: 

$$
\begin{align}
F_X(x) &= r \\
\frac{x^2}{4} &= r \\
x &= \sqrt{4r}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, to randomly sample $X$ and $Y$, we can sample a uniform distribution from 0 to 1, multiply it by four, and take its square root. These numbers can then be added together to sample $Z$:

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

sims <- 10000
Xs <- sqrt(4 * runif(n=sims))
Ys <- sqrt(4 * runif(n=sims))
Zs <- Xs + Ys

hist(Zs)
```

The histogram of the sample distribution of $Z$ is shown above.
